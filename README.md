## üöÄ What is PsMapExec?

**PsMapExec** is a PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework, heavily inspired by the well-known **CrackMapExec / NetExec** tools. It brings the familiar looks and function of these tools to native PowerShell with its own arsenal of improvements. This tool is designed to help penetration testers assess and dominate Active Directory environments with ease.
